# LLM-Based User Feedback & Response Application

## Overview

This application is an **LLM-powered feedback and response system**. Users provide feedback or commands via **text or voice**, and the system understands the intent and sentiment, then replies with a **polite, human-like acknowledgment**. The system does **not** control real hardware (e.g., AC temperature). It only interprets feedback and responds appropriately.

---

## What the Application Does

Users can say things like:

* "I am not feeling well"
* "It’s too hot here"
* "I am feeling cold"
* "I am uncomfortable"
* "Everything is fine now"

The system:

* Accepts **text or voice input**
* Converts voice to text (if needed)
* Uses an **LLM** to understand intent and emotion
* Generates a **calm, empathetic, professional response**

Example response:

> "Okay, I understand your concern. I’ve noted your feedback and appropriate action has been taken. Please let me know if you need anything else."

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React
* Text input field
* Microphone button (voice input)
* Chat-style UI

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* REST API to communicate with LLM

### AI / LLM

* OpenAI GPT / Gemini / any LLM
* Strong prompt engineering

### Voice (Optional)

* Speech-to-Text: Web Speech API or Whisper
* Text-to-Speech: Browser TTS API

## Core Concept: Prompt Engineering

The LLM must behave like a **feedback management assistant**, not a chatbot.

### System Prompt (Very Important)

```
You are a polite and professional feedback management assistant.

Your responsibilities:
- Understand user feedback or discomfort
- Detect intent and emotional tone
- Respond empathetically and professionally
- Do NOT mention technical details
- Do NOT ask unnecessary follow-up questions
- Acknowledge the feedback and reassure the user

If the user expresses discomfort, illness, or dissatisfaction:
- Show understanding
- Confirm that feedback has been noted or action has been taken

Keep responses short, calm, and friendly.
```

## Example User → LLM → Response Flow

### User Input

```
I am feeling very cold
```

### LLM Understanding

* Intent: Comfort issue
* Sentiment: Negative

### LLM Response

```
Okay, I understand your concern. I’ve noted your feedback and appropriate adjustments have been made. Please let me know if you need anything else.
```

---

## Backend API Logic (Conceptual)

### API Request

```json
{
  "message": "I am not feeling well"
}
```

### Backend Pseudo-Code

```
receive user message
send message + system prompt to LLM
get LLM response
return response text to frontend
```

---

## Voice Input Handling

### Option 1: Browser-Based (Simple)

* Use Web Speech API
* Convert voice → text
* Send text to backend

### Option 2: AI-Based (Better Accuracy)

* Use Whisper API

### Flow

```
Voice → Text → LLM → Response → (Optional Voice Reply)
```

---

## Optional: Intent Classification (Advanced)

The LLM can classify feedback into categories for better responses.

### Intent Categories

* HEALTH ("I am not feeling well")
* COMFORT ("It’s too hot", "I feel cold")
* COMPLAINT ("I’m uncomfortable")
* SATISFACTION ("Everything is fine")

### Classification Prompt

```
Classify the following user feedback into one category:
HEALTH, COMFORT, COMPLAINT, SATISFACTION

Return only the category name.
```

---

## Sample Responses by Intent

### HEALTH

> "I’m sorry to hear that. Your feedback has been noted, and support is available if you need anything."

### COMFORT

> "Thank you for informing me. I’ve noted your comfort-related feedback and appropriate action has been taken."

### COMPLAINT

> "I understand your concern. Your feedback has been recorded and we’re working to address it."

### SATISFACTION

> "That’s great to hear! Thank you for sharing your feedback."

## Key Points Summary

* This is a **feedback interpretation system**, not a control system
* LLM acts as the **brain** (intent + emotion understanding)
* Prompt design determines output quality
* Voice input is optional and treated as text internally
* Responses must always be polite, calm, and human-like

## Use Case Examples

* Smart feedback systems
* Facility feedback kiosks
* Customer comfort monitoring
* Conversational feedback bots
